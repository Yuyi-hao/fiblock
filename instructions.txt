How to read a Fibonacci Clock:
1. Color code: Each block has a specific color:
   - Red: Represents hours.
   - Blue: Represents minutes.
   - Green: Represents both hours and minutes.

2. Block Size: The length of each block corresponds to a Fibonacci number:
   - 1 block: 1
   - 2 block: 1
   - 3 blocks: 2
   - 4 blocks: 3
   - 5 blocks: 5

3. Hour Blocks: Add all the red and green blocks together to get the hour.

4. Minute Blocks: Add all the blue and green blocks together,
                  then multiply by 5 to get the minutes.

6. Example: For a clock with 3 red blocks, 5 blue blocks, and 1 green block:
   - Hours: 3 (red blocks)
   - Minutes: (5 blue blocks) x 5 = 25
   - Combined: Hours + Minutes + Green block value (if any).
